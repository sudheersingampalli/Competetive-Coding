You are given a string, which contains entirely of decimal digits (0-9). Each digit is made of a certain number of dashes, as shown in the image below. For instance 1 is made of 2 dashes, 8 is made of 7 dashes and so on.

digits made of dashes

You have to write a function that takes this string message as an input and returns a corresponding value in terms of a number. This number is the count of dashes in the string message.

Note:

0 consists of 6 dashes, 1 consists of 2 dashes, 2 consists of 5 dashes, 3 consists of 5 dashes, 4 consists of 4 dashes, 5 consists of 5 dashes, 6 consists of 6 dashes, 7 consists of 3 dashes [though the figure shows that 7 consists of 4 dashes but due to minor mistake in the problem please write your solution assuming 7 consists of 3 dashes], 8 consists of 7 dashes, 9 consists of 6 dashes.

Constraints
